<h1>About this Spotify application</h1>
<h3>Version: 1.0</h3>
<p>This is an Angular 2 app that implements the Spotify Web API to search artists and display 
    their albums and tracks. This was just a project to practice building a simple Angular 2 
    front-end application with help from the "Learn Angular 2 Development" course on Udemy.
